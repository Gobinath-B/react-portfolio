		title: "Pushing Limits: How We Triumphed in a 24-Hour Hackathon at SNS College of Technology",
		description: "In the world of technology, innovation and determination often go hand in hand. The ability to push one's limits and tackle complex challenges head-on is what sets exceptional individuals apart from the rest. This is the story of how a team of dedicated individuals, including myself, conquered the odds and emerged victorious in a grueling 24-hour hackathon at SNS College of Technology. A Surprising Start: The day began like any other. I checked my email and prepared for a regular day at the office, focusing on intern work. However, little did I know that the day would take an unexpected turn. I decided to take a break from work and attend a hackathon at CC1 Lab, organized by ihub. Setting the Stage: At 3 pm, the ihub organizers revealed the theme and problem statements for the hackathon. The atmosphere was charged with excitement as participants eagerly grabbed their refreshments and snacks. I chose a problem statement and took the lead in forming a team of four, each member possessing specialized technical abilities. The Long Night Begins: As the clock neared 6 to 7 pm, we had developed a solid plan of approach to tackle the problem. We decided to create a web application using embedded JavaScript, Express.js, and Google Firestore. However, the journey was far from smooth sailing. Throughout the night, we encountered numerous frontend issues and struggled with database modeling. To overcome these hurdles, we held countless meetings to design a standardized database model capable of handling data effectively. The Darkest Hour: By 6 am the following morning, exhaustion and headaches began to set in. After a quick breakfast, we realized the need to boost our productivity to meet the looming deadline. We meticulously scheduled our work and focused on prioritizing key modules. The pressure was mounting, but so was our determination. Facing the Jury: Amidst the sleepless night, we had to present our progress to a panel of judges in multiple review sessions. The scrutiny was intense, but we persevered, confident in our vision and solution. The Triumph: In the end, our hard work paid off. We successfully developed two modules—one for students and another for staff—to manage student activities and tasks. The task management module we implemented was a game-changer, detecting duplicate assessments and automatically rejecting them. Our five-pillar-based student management system significantly reduced the burden on staff, streamlining their processes. The Victory: Finally, at around 5:30 pm, the moment of truth arrived. The exhaustion, the sleepless night, and the endless challenges had all been worth it. We were declared the winners of the 24-hour hackathon at SNS College of Technology. Conclusion: This experience taught me that the human spirit is capable of extraordinary feats when fueled by passion and determination. I had never stayed awake for over 30 hours before, but in doing so, I discovered untapped potential within myself. The journey was challenging, but the triumph was sweet. It was a testament to the power of teamwork, perseverance, and pushing one's limits to achieve greatness in the world of technology. This victory serves as a reminder that innovation knows no bounds, and with the right mindset, we can conquer any obstacle that stands in our way. Big thanks to the Innovation hub team and all the organizers for encourage us to work over the night.",
